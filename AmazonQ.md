# Typaton Power-Up System Implementation

## Overview
I've implemented a power-up system for the Typaton typing game. This system adds special words that appear with rainbow blinking effects. When typed correctly, these words grant the player one of four power-ups:

1. **Freeze** - Stops all words for 3 seconds
2. **Slow** - Reduces word speed by 50% for 5 seconds
3. **Bomb** - Destroys all words on screen
4. **Shield** - Provides protection from one hit

## Implementation Details

### New Files Created
- **PowerUpManager.ts** - Core class that manages all power-up functionality
- **particle.png** - Simple particle image for the bomb effect

### Modified Files
- **GameScene.ts** - Updated to integrate power-ups
- **game/page.tsx** - Added instructions for power-ups

### Key Features

#### PowerUpManager Class
- Handles power-up spawning with 5% probability
- Manages active power-up states and durations
- Provides visual effects for power-up activation
- Displays UI indicators for active power-ups

#### Power-Up Effects
- **Freeze**: Completely stops word movement for 3 seconds
- **Slow**: Reduces word velocity by 50% for 5 seconds
- **Bomb**: Creates explosion effect and destroys all words
- **Shield**: Provides one-time protection from game over

#### Visual Indicators
- Power-up words have rainbow blinking effects
- Power-up activation shows large text animations
- Active power-ups display in the corner with timers
- Shield activation shows a protective circle animation

## How It Works

1. When spawning a word, there's a 5% chance it becomes a power-up
2. Power-up words are visually distinct with rainbow colors and blinking
3. When typed correctly, the power-up activates immediately
4. Active power-ups show in the UI with remaining duration
5. Each power-up has unique gameplay effects

## Future Improvements
- Add sound effects for power-up activation
- Create more advanced visual effects
- Implement additional power-up types
- Add power-up rarity tiers
